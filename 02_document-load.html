        When a browser loads a page, it loads it from the top down.
        If a script tag is written at the top of the page, it runs a line by line as it reads it.
        When the code executes, the page has not loaded, and the DOM object will not work.

        it will slow down the loading when js has to be loaded first before html page

        onload event will be triggered after the page completes loading. 
        
        However, in some cases, it may be necessary to place JavaScript in the head 
        section, such as when it is needed to initialize the page or to load external 
        scripts. In such cases, it is important to use techniques such as asynchronous 
        loading or defer attribute to minimize the impact on the page load time.
